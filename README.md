**Description:** Every healthcare provider (doctor, nurse, PA etc.) is assigned a National Provider Identifier (NPI), a unique ID number that identifies that provider nationally with the federal government. The NPI is generated and validated using the Luhn formula (which is also used for credit card numbers). Any time a user enters an NPI into any database across the healthcare system we are at risk of human error and mistyping. This has downstream impacts any time another user or system needs that data.

**Instructions:** Using the PDF link below (starting halfway down the first page) and the supplied list of NPI numbers, write a program or function in your language of choice that validates whether an NPI is correct or incorrect, using the Luhn algorithm (more info in the PDF). The precise implementation of the Luhn NPI check is up to you but aim for simplicity and conciseness in the solution.

**Display Requirements:** Generate a list of NPI numbers followed by a boolean value indicating whether they are valid (true) or invalid (false).
